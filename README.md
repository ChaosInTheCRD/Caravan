# Caravan
###  *A place to code when I'm on the road!*

### ðŸš¨ Caravan has temporarily moved to [nixos-config](https://github.com/chaosinthecrd/nixos-config)! ðŸš¨
I am in the middle of recreating all the configuration in this repository in the other repository (a fork of [MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config)). Once finished, I might move things back here (I like the caravan vibe), but until then please see the other repo for my current config.

This is where I store the configuration for my development environment. Using Nix and Home-Manager, I can quickly recreate my terminal environment wherever I like, including in cloud VMs.
